              I started learning how to code officially this year and what are
              better way to start that with ECX. Got bored while learning Java
              and decided to attend the first Python class and got an insight. I
              pushed myself quite hard and participated in the 30daysofcode
              organised for April and May. I wouldn't have had a better way to
              get exposed to the world of coding without the superb guidance and
              reception from the wonderful tutors and the atmosphere at ECX.

              many website and applications,which i made them responsive to all

              after completing all task given.I've been able to choose a
              framework which is ""React.js"" and i've started building
              applications alittle with it...All this testimonies wouldn't have

              ECX was my first ever official Python teaching experience. It was
              a learning process and with help from the rest of the team, we
              made it work. Also with the 30 days of code challenge, as a mentor
              I was taught more about consistency, working under pressure and
              with deadlines. It was very interesting and I think those words
              don't describe it enough. Finally, mentoring machine learning
              interns in the ECX Internship 1.0 was a fulfilling experience. It
              was nice to see students go from being total beginners to
              developers who can work on interesting projects.

              "A lot is all I can say. It helped me improve my python knowledge
              through hackathons and all. I started learning Flutter during the
              lockdown, with the ECX internship, I was able to add to my
              portfolio apps that I created within a short period of time. Also,
              I have been able to relate with different people through ECX, I'm
              normally an introvert but I have been able to manage it while
              working with people in teams at the internship and HackX. In
              summary, I have improved in both soft and hard skills, many thanks
